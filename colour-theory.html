        Colour psychology in interior design is well worth paying attention to.
        It can set the mood for how your guests feel when they come to visit you
        and how you feel every time you come home. You can literally use
        different colours to enable you to experience different feelings as you
        walk into a room. Once you start to understand the power of colour in
        your home, you can start to use it intentionally to allow you to
        influence how you feel in different parts of your home. <br><br>
        Have you ever walked into a sunny cafe with bright yellow walls and
        instantly felt livelier? Or entered the calm, of a spa decorated in
        soft, natural tones and felt an unmistakeable feeling of zen? The colour
        combinations and paint ideas used in your home can affect your mood in
        exactly the same way. It's important to rememnber though that whilst
        there is something of a science behind colours, at the end of the day,
        how you react to them is subjective. One person's idea of heaven with a
        black room is another person's idea of hell. So it's important to find
        the colours that work for you.

            Yellow is the colour of happiness, optimism and creativity. This is
            why it's such a great colour for children's spaces. Kids' bedrooms,
            playrooms - people instinctively use it in these rooms without
            understanding why. It is a colour that brings a smile to people's
            face when they walk into a yellow room. It comes in so many shades
            that from buttercup to mustard, there's a shade to suit every style
            of home from modern apartment to period house.

            Whilst orange isn't a millions miles away from yellow, it's a less
            popular colour but one that has no less positive connotations. It is
            an undeniable confident and positive colour that shows a bold
            personality. Remember that this colour has so many different
            permutations, it doesn't have to the bright, traffic light orange.
            If you like this colour but are a bit wary, look at something with
            touches of peach or leaning more towards pastel shades. If you love
            that really bold orange, remember colour doesn't just go on walls.
            Anything from a lovely orange velvet sofa to a small pop with a
            cushion can bring this beautiful, positive colour into your home.

            Red is a energizing, strong colour that evokes a strong reaction.
            It's conducive to socialising and strong personalities. That's why
            you often had one of the socialising rooms in grand old houses
            painted a strong red. Whilst you don't often see rooms painted
            entirely in red in more modern times, it can be a fantastic accent
            colour to make a statement. Some of the darker reds can be a
            gorgeous, daring choice for kitchen units.

            Pink is no longer the domain of little girl's bedrooms. With its
            resurgence in popularity in recent years, all the major paint brands
            continue to bring out very interesting shades of this once
            controversial colour. It's at once inviting, fun and grown up. The
            softer, earthier shades are fantastic to use in a bedrooom as its'
            softness lends itself to create a soothing feel. However, the
            stronger tones can work fantastically as show-stopping accent
            pieces. A staircase painted in a dark, moody pink in an otherwise
            neutral hallway would make a fantastic statement.

            Purple is often associated with luxury and elegance through its
            association with royalty. Indeed the darker variants of this colour
            can create an imposing presence when used on a wall. However the
            ligher shades, like lavender, can have a wonderfully calming effect.
            These tones are great used in bedrooms where the aim is to soothe.
            This is also why you often see them used in places people go to be
            calm such a meditation practices.

            Blue is one of the most versatile colours on the colour wheel. It
            can be used from everywhere from the bedroom to the living room to
            the kitchen. An incredibly peaceful colour, it's great for
            monochromatic schemes where you are pairing different shades of the
            same colour together in the same space. The dark navy that has been
            so popular in kitchens in recent times gives a room an edge whilst
            still allowing it to feel grounded.

            As everyone konws, green is the colour of nature. It is an innately
            peaceful colour in its purest form when close to forest colours. It
            is seen as a colour that promotes good luck and health. Like blue,
            it is a very versatile colour that comes in so many shades it can be
            used just about everywhere in the home. Wherever it is used, it
            creates a sense of peacefulness that is unequaled in any other
            colour.
